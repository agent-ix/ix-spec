# US-003: Install and use a community spec module

## Story

**As a** user adopting a community module
**I want** to install the module once under `~/.ix/filament/modules` (recorded in `~/.ix/filament/registry.json`), confirm that its types appear in the active catalog, and request those types in an authoring pack
**So that** the new vocabulary participates in authoring and validation just like the default modules.

## Context

A user extends the spec vocabulary with an additional artifact/object module
from a local path, GitHub repository, or package.

The expected command shape is:

```bash
quoin plugin install github:agent-ix/spec-objects-custom
quoin catalog list
quoin write . --types custom-object
```

The installed module should participate in the same authoring and validation
flow as the default modules. `quoin` maps the source argument to a typed
`ts-plugin-kit` source and hands off the install; `path` and GitHub (repository
and monorepo-subdir) sources install today, and the `package:`/npm mapping is in
place ready for when `ts-plugin-kit` adds npm install support.

## Dependencies

- Plugin install records are stored in `~/.ix/filament/registry.json`; modules
  are materialized under `~/.ix/filament/modules`.
- Catalog loading merges `QUOIN_MODULE_PATHS` overrides with installed modules
  deterministically (env paths first).
- Install/registry mechanics are delegated to `@agent-ix/ts-plugin-kit`.
